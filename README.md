# HTDB
The best repository that exists for idiots that don't know any high level programming languages.
---------------

## How do I get started?
My actual god, you haven't figured it out yet???

First off, clone this repository to a folder via **git clone https://github.com/BenjaminGotBanned/HTDB**

Next, open the **example.html** file and paste a valid token inside the **<token>** tags.

After that, your going to want to open a terminal inside of the **HTDB** folder.

When your terminal opens, type the following:
> backend.exe example.html

Then inside of the console, you should see that your bot is online.
